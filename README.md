## RELEASE examples

- Excluding merge pull request from release note

``` yaml
tag: v1.1.0

commitExclude:
  prefixes:
    - "Merge pull request #"
```

- Grouping commits by category in release note

``` yaml
tag: v1.1.0

commitCategories:
  - title: "Breaking Changes"
    contains:
      - change-category/breaking-change
  - title: "New Features"
    contains:
      - change-category/new-feature
  - title: "Notable Changes"
    contains:
      - change-category/notable-change
  - title: "Internal Changes"

releaseNoteGenerator:
  showCommitter: true
  useReleaseNoteBlock: true
```

- Multiple RELEASE files for mono-repo style

``` yaml
tag: foo-v0.1.0
name: foo

commitInclude:
  contains:
    - "application/foo"

releaseNoteGenerator:
  showAbbrevHash: true
  showCommitter: true
  useReleaseNoteBlock: true
```

- Multiple RELEASE files for mono-repo style (Include parent commits of the matching merge commit in `outoputs.release`)


``` yaml
tag: bar-v1.0.0
name: bar

commitInclude:
  parentOfMergeCommit: true
  prefixes:
    - "bar:"

releaseNoteGenerator:
  showAbbrevHash: true
  showCommitter: true
  useReleaseNoteBlock: true
  commitInclude:
    prefixes:
      - "bar:"
```
