``` yaml

commitExclude:
  prefixes:

```

- Grouping commits by category in release note

``` yaml
tag: v1.1.0

commitCategories:
  - title: "Breaking Changes"
    contains:
      - change-category/breaking-change

    contains:
      - change-category/notable-change
  - title: "Internal Changes"

releaseNoteGenerator:
  showCommitter: true
  useReleaseNoteBlock: true
```

- Multiple RELEASE files for mono-repo style

``` yaml
tag: foo-v0.1.0

commitInclude:
  contains:
    - application/foo
```

``` yaml
